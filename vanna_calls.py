BUSINESS_CONTEXT = """
IMPORTANT BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- respondent: Core table of the database. Nearly all table connect through this table.
- almost all table connect though a column called email. 
- unsubscribe_blacklist contains opted-out emails — ALWAYS exclude them

CRITICAL RULES YOU MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW:
1. ALWAYS exclude emails that appear in the unsubscribe_blacklist table from ANY query 
   result that returns respondent emails or counts unless specified otherwise. Always use:
   AND email NOT IN (SELECT email FROM unsubscribe_blacklist)
   or a LEFT JOIN with WHERE unsubscribe_blacklist.email IS NULL.
2. Never query the error_log table.
3. Always use lowercase table and column names.
4. Use PostgreSQL syntax only.
5. DISREGARD is_deleted and is_active columns from respondent and respondent_type_specification tables in your queries unless specified in the question.
7. When you run a SQL query that returns data, DO NOT generate a Markdown table of the results in your text response. 
   The user interface will automatically display the data. Your text response should only be a brief summary of what you found, never the raw rows themselves.
8. Several columns in the database are PostgreSQL enum types, not plain text. 
   These include but are not limited to: country, uk_region, county_state, gender, 
   ethnicity, relationship, job_status, job_title_tier, industry, 
   highest_education_level, annual_household_income, company_size, company_turnover, 
   years_in_business, approximate_salary_bracket, project_state, company_turnover.
   
   For ANY column that filters by a categorical or descriptive value, NEVER assume 
   the format or use abbreviations. Always use the full stored value exactly as it 
   appears in the database. For example: 'United States of America' not 'US', 
   'United Kingdom' not 'UK', 'Male' not 'M'.
   
   When unsure of the exact enum value, use ILIKE for partial matching instead:
   WHERE column::text ILIKE '%keyword%' This casts the enum to text first which avoids type errors entirely.
9. ALWAYS qualify every column name with its table alias when writing JOIN queries.
   Never write SELECT email, SELECT country etc when multiple tables are joined.
   Always write SELECT r.email, SELECT a.country etc.
   This applies to WHERE clauses, ON clauses, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY as well.
   Example: WHERE r.email NOT IN (...) not WHERE email NOT IN (...).
10.When a question asks for a LIST of people or records, always include at minimum:
   r.email, r.first_name, r.last_name in the SELECT. Never return email alone 
   as a list — it is not human readable enough.
11.When a question asks to COUNT something, return a single aliased column.
    Example: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT r.email) AS total_respondents
    Never return an unnamed count column.
12.When joining respondent to addresses, always use LEFT JOIN not INNER JOIN unless 
    the question specifically requires an address field to be present. Many respondents 
    may not have an address record and an INNER JOIN would silently exclude them from 
    counts.
13.Never use SELECT * in any query. Always specify the columns you need explicitly.
14. When filtering by date, always use TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE safe comparisons.
    Example: WHERE created_date >= '2024-01-01'::timestamptz
    Never assume a date column is plain DATE type.
